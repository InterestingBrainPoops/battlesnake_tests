# battlesnake_tests
A collection of battlesnake JSON states along with their expected move.  Feel free to use this to test any of your battlesnakes.

## Format  
Each test will be in a folder of its own in the `/tests/` folder.  
The input will be provided in `input.json` and the expected output will be `output.json`.  
For example, test number 03 can be found at : `/tests/03/input.json`.  
The inputs and outputs are currently compliant with the API v1 for battlesnake.  
  
## Difficulty  
These tests might be very hard, and that is the intention. There might be some easier tests in there, but most of them are intended to strain your evaluation function.  
  
## Thanks
This was inspired by the [PoorFish](https://github.com/mcostalba/PoorFish) testset for chess engines.
